Today i decided to change some thing within my project design. Instead of using a esp32 with camera module i decided to use a normal webcam for facial recognition as an EPS32 is really not nessesary for my project. I consulted paul and brian and they seem to be okay with it. I updated my project proposal and subbmitted again.
