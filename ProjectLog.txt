Today is the dealline for our project proposal. I showed my propsoal to Brian today and got some feed back on my architecture diagram. After making some changes to my architecture diagram i finally submitted my project proposal.

Today i decided to change some thing within my project design. Instead of using a esp32 with camera module i decided to use a normal webcam for facial recognition as an EPS32 is really not nessesary for my project. I consulted paul and brian and they seem to be okay with it. I updated my project proposal and subbmitted again.

Last week for the 9th of november i forgot to update my log for the research that i was doing on docker containers and how they work as im playing on setting up everything on my local server on a docker container and have all the work transfered to my AWS after christmas within the container. This week i couldnt really get much done as im pretty busy with assignments.

24/11/2020
Today i installed ubuntu with python and docker. I also installed django and got my webserver running on my localhost. Im having trouble trying to understand docker as its not working correctly for me. I will conintue to research this and find a solution.

This week i tried resolving some issues i was having with docker but i was unsuccessful. Im going to skip over docker for now and continue working on django and rasa. I also have ordered my webcam off amazon so i can start working on the azure facial recognition.

I installed rasa and have got the sample code for the chat bot working. I can interact with the bot via a terminal. I have also installed azure facial recognition but i havnt got that set up properly yet. im hoping to have it verifying faces soon. I will be using example code to test and make sure if the azure facial recognition is set up correctly.

I havent been working on my project over the past week as ive had alot of assignments and exams coming up. I plan on working on the project during christmas break 

01/01/2021
Over the past two week i was very busy with assignments and coding exams which didnt give me much time to work on this project. I startred where i last left off which was installing azure facial recognition. Im running into a few problems with my webcam but currentlyu havent found a soultion for it. I plan to continue 
working on this until i fix it. As soon as i get the problem fixed i will be able to start detecting faces and emotions using azure api. I then will start development on the bot to improve it.

Over the past couple days i was focusing on getting azure facial recognition to work. Using sample code form microsoft i have it decting emotions from images but currently looking on how to get 
it to detect emotions from a live stream which is alot more complicated.I also focused on getting my webcam stream onto my localhost server. This was fairly time consuiming as to do that i had to do
alot of more stuff with djano like setting up templates for pages, setting url patterns and writing some simple code into views.py. I done alot of research in order to do this as can be seen in the research.txt 
reference. Over the past few days i broke my ubuntu which caused to have alot of errors using it. I spent about 7-8 hours trying to fix it which i did. I also spent alot of time figuing out how to install the python packages for azure 
in inteliji as i was going to need them. There isnt much infomation out there on this matter which caused me to spend several hours on it. I was initalling the lastest mega library from azure which kept causing my python to crash and give me errors
which was weird because all other packages where being installed fine. After digging around on github i found out there was a problem with the python package lastest version which i than just installed the previous version which was 4.0.0. I was happy 
i finally got it done and somewhat working. I havnt touched the chatbot yet as i feel i can do that very easily just to get it to commuicate better before the presentation hence wy i was focued more on the azure and django stuff.
I plan to hopefulyl get the azure facial recognition working with my webcam stream before the presentaitons aswell as have the bot commiucate somehow with a human.

08/01/2021
made alot of changes to the bot and now have it communicatig to the user where it will ask users name and reply with to the user with their name and ask about how theyre day is etc etc. 
Im only currently working on the happy path and have no started on other emotions yet. I change alot of the NLU data aswell and started righting custom actions for slop mapping in order to take users name 
aswell as if theyre happy and why theyre happy. Still alot of work to be done on the happy path and im no where were id like to be but im finding this challeneging which is good i guess.

09/01/2021
Today i progressed with rasa. I used a sample chatbox for my website which i got from github off a rasa developer. This means my bot can now communicate with you via my website through the bots API which 
is pretty cool as before i was only able to communicate with the bot via shell. I ran into a lot of problems trying this as i had to set up static files for django which is okay because i had to
do that at somepoint within this project. I also changed something with the azure facial recognition. Now i can get a link to any photo online and get the emotions displayed in that photo. I tried  capturing a photo from my webcam and using that to detect emotions but 
it didnt work and im now abit stuck. I feel like i made good progress today and my presentation will go well with what i have currently working. There is still alot to do and its going to be very challenging as right now its already tough.

10/01/2021
Today i finizled some changes for my christmas demo. I made my video demo but i feel as the timeframe we were giving was too little to go through everything and all the work i had done doesnt seem like it got covered. I have uploaded my video
and my questionaire. 

27/01/2021
I have research ways to try get azure face to detect emotions through live feed but havnt really found anything and if i have they are just too complicated for what im trying to do. Im thinking of taking snapshots of my webcam live feed 
and saving the images to my server for processing. This way i can bacially detect emotions through a feed. Its not the best way but im trying to give it a go anyways to see if it even works.

02/02/2021
Ive been trying to figure out how to save images on my localhost server then analyze those images for dections. Im making abit of progress but not as much as id like to. Im hoping to get this done by the end of next week and start working on converstaion paths.
Ive been looking online on how to do this but there really isnt much out there as im going to need a image URL for the image to detect the emotions and im not sure if thats even possible.
